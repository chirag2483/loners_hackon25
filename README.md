## 🚩 Problem 1: The 20-Minute Browsing Black Hole  
**💡 Solution: Context-Aware Movie Recommender**

- Health, emotion & location context  

Trained on the LDOS-CoMoDa dataset using a multi-context deep learning pipeline, it offers hyper-personalized movie suggestions tailored to your current vibe.
